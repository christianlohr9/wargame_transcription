## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Remote Ollama for chat (offloads RAM, allows larger models)
- WhisperX + pyannote for diarization (no API dependency, CPU-only acceptable)
- Batch diarization processing (CPU-only is slow, overnight jobs acceptable)
- Conductor UI on port 5001 (macOS AirPlay conflict on port 5000)

### Deferred Issues
